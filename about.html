                <div class="bio-narrative">
                    <p>I am a Seattle Native who is conquering the midwest at the University of Michigan studying User Experience Design & Quantitative Methods. I am a senior undergraduate student also continuing on to receive an accelerated Masters in Information specialized in User Centered Agile Development. </p>
                    
                    <p>I believe designers need more skills than just creating and prototyping to be a great designers. That is why I am learning design and development skills, putting that together to make the product lifecycle more efficient and effective. </p>
                    
                    <h3>My Design Philosophy</h3>
                    <p>It is most important to me to identify the problem and keep it at the forefront of my design and solution. I believe that technology has the capacity to transform lives; designers just need to remember whose needs need to be prioritized based on the problem being solved. A crucial part of that involves including those who may be typically forgotten.</p>
